    <h1>Retro AstroSphere - Web Showcase</h1>
    <h2>Andrew Borders</h2>
    <p>I built this project alone over a 2 week period, learning a lot about game design and 3d graphics in the process.</p>
    <p>The trickiest part of this project has been the camera movement. It's surprisingly hard to smoothly orient the camera with gravity.</p>
